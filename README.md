# Santorini

Hi Guys!!

This is a small project where I am using Unity 3D to translate the board game of Santorini to computers.Rules of Santorini:

Feel free to use this link to the Trello board (https://trello.com/invite/b/bk99c5aQ/256d73818eede30a584b29faae01a99b/santorini-project-board) 
to look for tasks that need to be done. 

A couple ground rules: 

1. All tickets need to be tested by another team member
2. Familiarise yourself with the rules of Santorini and the code
3. To commit changes always exclude the Temp files
